And by the way 
And can they see in the dark 
And cheer her they did 
And Clarke s serves the staple right 
Anderson finished with a complete game one hitter 
Anderson knows coaches 
Anderson struggled to put weight on the foot 
And everything is a priority in education 
And for safety 
And he accepted that 
And he affirmed Clinton s case 
And he answered me 
And he did agree to meet us 
And he did connect 
And he just shrugged his shoulders 
And he never saw it again 
And here s the flipside of this principle 
And hey it worked 
And his integrity is unquestionable 
And how does she die 
And how do you power these probes 
And I can agree with that 
And I can t get clean 
And I dont flaunt those 
And I dont want it 
And I lie a lot 
And I love my teams 
And I mean it this time 
And Im glad I did 
And Im happy with that 
And interactive it was 
And I own my own business 
And I support that belief 
And it continues to develop slowly 
And it deserves to be acknowledged 
And it gets really emotional 
And it gives good results 
And it has strings 
And I think that s market wide 
And I think they re on a pedestal 
And it masked the taste of the meat 
And its a bad deal 
And it s affordable entertainment 
And it s already taking root 
And it s an escape 
And its an important distinction too 
And it s appropriate 
And its endless 
And it s happening 
And it shows in the work 
And it s no ma and pa venture 
And it s not as simple as it sounds 
And its the working class 
And it was clear 
And it was hilarious 
And it was so powerful 
And it will show in the final result 
And look at the results 
And maybe even a margarita 
And no parcel tax

And so ends our quiz 
And somehow they manage 
And some old timers return too 
And sometimes indoor track 
And so thats the problem 
And that is always a good thing 
And that is just unfortunate 
And that is quite something 
And that is too bad 
And that price could be severe 
And that s amazing 
And that s just for the presentation 
And thats just incorrect 
And that s just recent history 
And that s just the beginning 
And thats just the half of it 
And that s our trade off

And the world has questions 
And they all know that 
And they almost achieved their goal 
And they also hauled the items

And they are telling the world 
And they can still be quite wealthy 
And they continued to grow 
And they do a spectacular job 
And they havent known 
And they really like it 
And theyre interesting stories 
And they should be optimistic 
And they take control of the situation 
And they tell the tale 
And they understand 
And they want it back 
And they were daring 
And they were so sad about it 
And things happen fast 
And this is a huge but 
And this is an anything 
And this isnt really a new practice 
And this is really big

But she never got the role 
But she received positive reactions 
But she set the wrong car on fire 
But she trudged on 
But smooth enough 
But so are the tragic possibilities 
But socialism is a wonderful sounding idea 
But sometimes the audience doesnt care 
But Stewart had a ready reply 
But still I enjoyed collecting 
But stuff happens 
But suicide is rarely simple 
But thank you all 
But that forgiveness begins with repentance 
But that image is slowly changing 
But that s hardly all 
But thats just his daytime activity 
But thats not exactly right 
But thats not reality 
But that s the nature of teaching 
But the animals mowed the grass 
But the answers are not that easy 
But theatre sure did 
But the building had a lively history 
But the cast is up for the challenge 
But the content is hilarious 
But the first deposit was a fake 
But the freebies are over 
But the measure has not advanced 
But the oceans are over 
But the offer was rejected 
But the real draw is the music 
But theres no hidden message 
But the results are feeble 
But the results can be quite curious 
But the score is well done 
But these aren t normal circumstances 
But the show must go on 
But the storm raged throughout the night 
But the story goes deeper 
But the template was set 
But the tests are pretty standard 
But the Warriors didnt quit 
But they also acknowledged the challenges 
But they could 
But they hauled water for the house 
But they kept coming back 
But they re not all bad 
But they re still handmade 
But they shouldnt be invisible 
But they want to exterminate us 
But they were very old 
But they wont come from the state 
But things can go awry 
But things may be changing 
But this big boy is tasty 
But this figure is certainly too low 
But this is a duplicitous claim 
But this is a false equivalency 
But this is not an ordinary spring 
But this is not good news 
But this is not the issue 
But this is not the reality 
But this is not the right solution 
But this time shes silent 
But this time things are different 
But unfortunately the flood happened 
But usually it stopped there 
But Vikram was determined 
But we call it wrongly 
But we cant sell it 
But we dont do that 
But we dont read it 
But we found other diversions 
But we have to stay the course 
But we love it now 
But we re really nervous 
But what about lectures 
But what can we expect 
But what is the risk of a blue steak 
But who were the Samaritans 
But why do we need it 
But why is it so pleasing 
But you cant always find a vacant school 
But you need a ring 
But you probably didn t mean them 
But youre sitting on a booster 
But you want to be combative 
But you won t see them for some time

It is in the Algonquin neighborhood 
It is just a different world for female players 
It is moving at a snails pace 
It is my alarm clock 
It is not affected by optimism bias

It is useful to track progress 
It is very dramatic and very rewarding

It just fuels their fire 
It just requires technological investment 
It just wouldnt fly 
It keeps people fascinated

It s a big concern for us 
It s a big look for autumn winter 
It s a bit of a mini history lesson 
It s a bit of a modern day fairytale 
It s a bit of a stretch 
Its about both 
Its about taking your chances 
Its about the perfect time too 
Its about the right influencer for your audience

You can understate them too 
You can watch it on TV 
You can watch that video here 
You can watch the clip here 
You can work on a response in the meantime 
You certainly represent your mindset well 
You clearly didnt 
You could criticize some of these announcements 
You could feel every shift of gears 
You could have guessed it 
You could hear the gas burning 
You could learn something 
You couldn t transplant it 
You could really see the cause and effect 
You could say he was strict 
You could see the Western influence 
You could spend all day at the NFL Experience

You do this consistently 
You embrace the opportunities 
You get the same warning with many medications 
You get these cases 
You get to play every night 
You get to share it with people 
You get to work it out 
You have a beautiful place 
You have a big episode order 
You have a son and a daughter 
You have a weekly routine 
You have given an incentive for fragmentation 
You have lost our trust 
You have lost your creditability 
You have no business there 
You have no need or entitlement 
You have some good points 
You have to ask them 
You have to come home 
You have to hack your target 
You have to help these people 
You have to take the long view 
You have to try the soups 
You heard that correctly 
You hear the new album 
You just don t get it 
You just don t kill people 
You just dont know it yet 
You just try to stay there 
You know his face 
You know Im heartbroken 
You learn their background and careers 
You leave the restaurant in disgust 
You led me all the way 
You lose staff 
You lost me completely 
You love the person 
You made that up 
You make me proud 
You may answer 
You may be laughing already 
You may continue Hon Member 
You might feel overwhelmed 
You might like a beverage too 
You must be an artist 
You must be proud of yourself 
You must value yourself 
You need a lot of repetitions 
You need the onions 
You need the x factor for that game 
You need to achieve the right balance 
You need to identify the parties 
You never have to eat the rind

You re not interested in truth or justice

Youre paying for lettuce or spinach 
Youre still trying to prove yourself

You should catch up on the news 
You should run with it 
You should stop

You think about death and survival 
You think of the various angles 
You think the O is bad 
You took good care of Him
